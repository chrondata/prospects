<div class="interactive_about"><a name="about_data"></a>
<p><em><a name="updates"></a>Update, October 23, 4 p.m. -</em> The list has been updated to include 2013 figures for the Alzheimer's Association and the Carter Center and updated figures for Texas Tech. Habitat for Humanity's data were previously listed as including affiliates, but they do not. Additionally, we have added 2012 figures for Arc Thrift Stores, the Cleveland Clinic, the Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation of America, the Nemours Foundation, the Energy Foundation, the Greater Cincinnati Foundation, and NeighborWorks America. The list and rankings have been updated to reflect these changes.</p>
<p><em>Corrections, October 27, 4 p.m. -</em> The URL for Christian Advocates Serving Evangelism was erroneously pointing to au.org, which is the website for Americans United for Separation of Church and State. It has been updated to correctly point to aclj.org, which is the American Center for Law and Justice which does business as Christian Advocates Serving Evangelism, Inc.</p>
<p><em>Update, October 28, 5 p.m. -</em> The list has been updated to include affiliate data for both United States Fund for Unicef and Habitat for Humanity International. The footnote &ldquo;organization raised at least half of donations in products&rdquo; has been removed from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The list and rankings have been updated to reflect these changes.</p>
<p><em>Update, October 30, 10 a.m. - </em>The list has been updated to correct private-support figures for World Vision. The list and rankings have been updated to reflect these changes.</p>
<p><em>Update, November 7, 4 p.m. -</em> The Greater Kansas City Community Foundation provided incorrect figures for private support in our Philanthropy 400 survey. The list and rankings have been updated to reflect the correct numbers, which do not include data for affiliates.</p>
<h2>About the Data</h2>
<p><strong>How <em>The Chronicle</em> Compiled Its Philanthropy 400 Rankings of the Largest Charities</strong></p>
<p>The Philanthropy 400 ranks charities that raised the most money from private sources in fiscal year 2013.</p>
<p>The rankings are based on cash and product donations as well as stock, land, and other gifts from individuals, corporations, and foundations in the United States.</p>
<p>The Philanthropy 400 is designed to show which groups do the best in appealing to donors, so other types of income, such as government payments, are not included.</p>
<p>Donations raised outside the United States are also excluded, even if an organization has affiliates overseas.</p>
<p>To gather data on private donations, <em>The Chronicle</em> used Internal Revenue Service Form 990 informational tax filings. It also examined financial statements and annual reports and sent a survey to all nonprofits likely to make the list.</p>
<p>Organizations with affiliates are ranked based on consolidated figures; because some successful fundraising groups cannot provide this information, they do not appear on the list.</p>
<p>Information is based on donations each group raised in its 2013 fiscal year. In 32 cases, organizations said they could not provide 2013 figures, so <em>The Chronicle</em> used 2012 figures to rank them.</p>
<p><em>The Chronicle</em> aims to draw all figures from similar sources so that it can compare the data fairly. However, in some cases that&rsquo;s not practical. For instance, because public colleges do not have to file informational returns, <em>The Chronicle</em> relies on data collected by the Council for Aid to Education for both public and private colleges.</p>
<p>Because the council does not allow institutions to count pledges, as the 990 allows, figures for colleges can easily be compared within that group but not to other institutions of a similar size.</p>
<p><strong>Religious Groups</strong></p>
<p>Religious groups are not required by law to file informational tax forms, but some voluntarily provided fundraising data so <em>The Chronicle</em> could rank them, while others declined.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s Philanthropy 400 was able to include a consolidated figure on food banks affiliated with Feeding America. In the past, some of those food banks were included separately. To help readers see how each food bank fared, we have created <a href="/article/Private-Support-to-Individual/149471/" target="_blank">a separate list</a> highlighting how much 20 of the largest food banks raised from private sources.</p>
<p><em>The Chronicle</em> strives to include all charities that may be eligible for the Philanthropy 400. To suggest a group for inclusion, please send an email to: <a href="mailto:research@philanthropy.com">research@philanthropy.com</a></p>
